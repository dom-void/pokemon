2. List Pokemons available in the game:  
a. Table should contain at least 10 Pokemons,  
b. Columns should include Pokemon’s image, name, HP,  
c. Table should have some sort of pagination.  
3. Images should rotate on mouse hover.  
4. Create a separate page with Pokemon’s details containing:  
a. Pokemon’s speed, attack, defence stats,  
b. Reference to it’s evolution forms.  
5. Add at least one unit/integration test.
